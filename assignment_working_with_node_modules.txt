2. What are ES6 modules and how do they differ from the module we
created in this checkpoint?

ES6 modules do the same thing as commonjs modules, but just do it
in a more clear way.

eg.
ES6 syntax:

IN FILE NAMED..."sayHello.js"
export function helloYou() {console.log("Hello You!");};

IN FILE NAMED..."index.js"
import {helloYou} from 'sayHello';
